<h2>Boot + Middleman: The ClojureScript development environment of my dreams</h2>
<p><em>This is a repost. You can find the original <a title="Boot + Middleman: The ClojureScript development environment of my dreams" href="https://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/the-front-end-development-environment-of-my-dreams">here</a></em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting closer to the frontend development environment of my dreams. The
combination of editor integration, live browser reload, and not having to
manually run commands over and over is time-saving and a pleasure to
work with.</p>

<p>At Hashrocket, designers and developers work very closely
together. Visual design and markup is handled by our
designers, who create &ldquo;stubbed out&rdquo; templates in <a href="http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/managing-design-handoffs-with-the-ui-controller">the UI
directory</a>.
It&rsquo;s a process that works very well for us, and
allows us to iteratively add features to an application.</p>

<p>This process has served us very well in Rails using a <a href="http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/managing-design-handoffs-with-the-ui-controller">UI
controller</a>,
available only in development mode.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using ClojureScript a lot lately, particularly with Om, and
have missed that directory of collaboration. After all, the designers
at Hashrocket have a proclivity for HAML and SASS.</p>

<p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve set up a separate repository using <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> to
handle markup and styles, using <code>middleman build</code>, copying the generated
CSS files, and eyeballing the generated markup to ensure it matched the
Om component&rsquo;s markup. Aside from being tedious, it&rsquo;s really easy to
get out of sync with a manual process like this. The static resource
generation should be a part of our build process.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://boot-clj.com">boot</a>.</p>

<h3>Using Boot for ClojureScript development</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the Clojure world, you may have heard of <a href="http://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a>,
which is the de facto dependency management and build tool for
Clojure/Script. Boot is similar to Leiningen, but adds the ability to
compose tasks to create build pipelines. This composability, along with
some really smart architectural decisions, is what makes boot a great
choice for the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Adzerk&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/adzerk-oss/boot-cljs-example">example repo</a>
is a great way to get started with ClojureScript and boot. Of particular
note is the <code>build.boot</code> file. It demonstrates how one can build
up a <code>dev</code> task that watches a directory for changes, rebuilding
ClojureScript sources, and notifying the browser to reload the code. It
includes the setup necessary for source maps, a development server,
and the browser-connected REPL. But what I want to add to that pot
of awesome is the ability to compile HAML and SASS as a part of the
pipeline.</p>

<h3>boot-middleman: Gluing Everything Together</h3>

<p>I had an epiphany one night after working on this problem for a while: I
can just use Middleman. After all, boot and the ClojureScript compiler
run on the JVM, and JRuby is easily embeddable. After a short bit, I
came up with <a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/boot-middleman">boot-middleman</a>, the glue I needed to build HAML/SASS as
a part of my build process.</p>

<p>It assumes a subdirectory is a Middleman app (<code>assets</code> by default). This
works nicely because my designer pals can collaborate with me without
having to use the JVM at all. They just run <code>middleman</code> in the <code>assets</code>
subdirectory and work as normal.</p>

<p>See the boot-middleman README for instructions on setting up.</p>

<p>I used this workflow to create a minesweeper clone, <a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/minesweeper">the
source</a> of which is on GitHub.
Just clone and run <code>boot dev</code>.</p>

<h3>The Workflow in Action</h3>

<p>To see the workflow in action, check out the following video. It
demonstrates how editing front-end files do not require a manual browser
refresh to see the effects.</p>
