<h2>Using Recursive SQL with ActiveRecord trees</h2>
<p><em>This is a repost. You can find the original <a title="Using Recursive SQL with ActiveRecord trees" href="http://hashrocket.com/blog/posts/recursive-sql-in-activerecord">here</a></em></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> When you have an ActiveRecord tree structure, using the WITH syntax for recursive SQL can provide large performance boons, especially when a tree get several levels deep.</p>

<p>In a <a title="SQL Window Functions and You" href="http://blog.hashrocket.com/posts/sql-window-functions">previous post</a>, I outlined a Cat Picture store application. As our store grows, more and more categories have to be created, and we end up with a tree of categories.
How can we create a homepage that includes all cat pictures for a given category <em>and</em> all of its subcategories?</p>

<p>Pictorally, the category tree might look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext">Cat Pictures
|-- Funny
|   |-- LOLCats
|   `-- Animated
`-- Classic
    `-- Renaissance
</code></pre>

<p>On the landing page for the <em>Cat Pictures</em> category, we want to display
all cat pictures for any category below <em>Cat Pictures</em>. Navigating to
the <em>Funny</em> category would display all of its pictures, as well as the
pictures for <em>LOLCats</em> and <em>Animated</em>. This is the kind of interaction
seen on Amazon, for example. The store&rsquo;s categories become like an
ad-hoc filtering system.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the Category class looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Category</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="n">attr_accessible</span> <span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:parent</span>

  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:cat_pictures</span>
  <span class="n">belongs_to</span> <span class="ss">:parent</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:class_name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Category"</span>
  <span class="n">has_many</span> <span class="ss">:children</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:class_name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"Category"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:foreign_key</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'parent_id'</span>

  <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="ss">:top_level</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:parent_id</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kp">nil</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">descendents</span>
    <span class="c1"># implement me!</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Each category has a <code>parent_id</code> column that points at its parent
category. In database speak, modeling a tree like this is known as
an <em>Adjacency List</em>; each node of the tree can only see a children
immediately adjacent to it. For this reason, crawling an Adjacency List
requires recursion. This is actually the database setup common for use
with the <code>acts_as_tree</code> plugin. Let&rsquo;s see how we can implement the
<code>descendents</code> method to get all descendent categories.</p>

<h2>A Simple Ruby Approach</h2>

<p>As you&rsquo;ve probably already guessed, we need to recursively collect
children for each of our category&rsquo;s children.</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Category</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">descendents</span>
    <span class="n">children</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">child</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">child</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">descendents</span>
    <span class="k">end</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">flatten</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This does the job quite nicely. However, our requirements above state
that we want all cat pictures for each descendent category, <em>and our
categories</em>. Right now, we&rsquo;ve omitted the root category, self. Let&rsquo;s add
a new method to include it into the equation:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Category</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">descendents</span>
    <span class="n">children</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">child</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">child</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">child</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">descendents</span>
    <span class="k">end</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">flatten</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">self_and_descendents</span>
    <span class="o">[</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">descendents</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Good deal. Now gathering all cat pictures is just a matter of collecting
them for each category:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Category</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>
  <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">descendent_pictures</span>
    <span class="n">self_and_descendents</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="ss">:cat_pictures</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">flatten</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>For a tree like we have above, this is probably good enough. Our tree is
only 3 levels deep. We&rsquo;ve introduced plenty of N+1 queries, but given
our small dataset, that shouldn&rsquo;t be a huge concern.</p>

<p>That said, as our store grows, and the tree gets deeper and more
detailed, this kind of implementation could become a bottleneck. Also,
because we&rsquo;re doing Array operations on the <code>children</code> collection,
we lose the ability to take advantage of ActiveRelation outside of the
<code>descendents</code> method itself. Among other things, this means that we
can&rsquo;t eager-load cat pictures unless we always eager-load them within
the <code>descendents</code> method.</p>

<p>Surely we can do better.</p>

<h2>SQL WITH queries</h2>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re using PostgreSQL, we can take advantage of its special
features. In this case, we can use a WITH query. From the <a title="WITH queries" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/queries-with.html">PostgreSQL
documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WITH provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger
query. These statements, which are often referred to as Common Table
Expressions or CTEs, can be thought of as defining temporary tables that
exist just for one query.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On its own, this might not seem like a big deal, but when combined with
the optional RECURSIVE modifier, WITH queries can become quite powerful:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional RECURSIVE modifier changes WITH from a mere syntactic
convenience into a feature that accomplishes things not otherwise
possible in standard SQL. Using RECURSIVE, a WITH query can refer to
its own output. A very simple example is this query to sum the integers
from 1 through 100:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext"> WITH RECURSIVE t(n) AS (
     VALUES (1)
   UNION ALL
     SELECT n+1 FROM t WHERE n &lt; 100
 )
 SELECT sum(n) FROM t;
</code></pre>

<p>The general form of a recursive WITH query is always a non-recursive
term, then UNION (or UNION ALL), then a recursive term, where only the
recursive term can contain a reference to the query&rsquo;s own output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, the expression contained in the AS statement has two
parts. The first part is executed just once. The second part, after the
UNION ALL, is executed until it returns an empty result set.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of WITH RECURSIVE, we can reduce our tree crawling
technique from <em>n</em> queries to just 1! Let&rsquo;s how we can use this to crawl
our category tree.</p>

<p>As a reminder, here&rsquo;s what our categories table looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext"># SELECT id, name, parent_id FROM categories;

 id |     name     | parent_id 
----+--------------+-----------
  1 | Cat Pictures |          
  2 | Funny        |         1
  3 | LOLCats      |         2
  4 | Animated     |         2
  5 | Classic      |         1
  6 | Renaissance  |         5
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the query:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight sql"><span class="k">WITH</span> <span class="k">RECURSIVE</span> <span class="n">category_tree</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ARRAY</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">categories</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">parent_id</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NULL</span>
<span class="k">UNION</span> <span class="k">ALL</span>
  <span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
  <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">category_tree</span>
  <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="n">categories</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">parent_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">category_tree</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
  <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">ANY</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">category_tree</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Running the query above returns the following:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext"> id |     name     |  path   
----+--------------+---------
  1 | Cat Pictures | {1}
  2 | Funny        | {1,2}
  3 | LOLCats      | {1,2,3}
  4 | Animated     | {1,2,4}
  5 | Classic      | {1,5}
  6 | Renaissance  | {1,5,6}
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa! That&rsquo;s a lot of SQL. Let&rsquo;s break it down a bit. </p>

<h3>Declare the Table Expression</h3>

<p>First, we declare our &ldquo;temporary table&rdquo; using the WITH syntax. We&rsquo;re
going to call it <code>category_tree</code>. This &ldquo;table&rdquo; has 3 &ldquo;columns&rdquo;: <code>id</code>,
<code>name</code>, and <code>path</code>. The <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> columns are fairly obvious; they
refer to corresponding columns on the categories table. The <code>path</code> is an
array of ids that each row will have. More on this in a bit.</p>

<h3>Define the Non-recursive Term</h3>

<p>The non-recursive term is next:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight sql"><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ARRAY</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">categories</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">parent_id</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NULL</span>
</code></pre>

<p>It grabs the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> for each top-level category, that is, each
category that has no parent. It also initializes an array containing just
its <code>id</code>. On its own, this isn&rsquo;t very interesting, but this array will
become helpful during the recursive step of the query.</p>

<h3>Define the Recursive Term</h3>

<p>The recursive term is the juiciest bit of the query:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight sql"><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">path</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">category_tree</span>
<span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="n">categories</span> <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">parent_id</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">category_tree</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="n">categories</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">ANY</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we&rsquo;re selecting from <code>category_tree</code>. By doing this, we&rsquo;re
able to use each result set in the subsequent iteration. The first time
we recurse, the result set will be what we selected in the non-recursive
term above.</p>

<p>Given that we have a root result set, we join with <code>categories</code> to find
its children. From our new result set, we select <code>id</code> and <code>name</code>, as
before. But this time, we concatenate the child id onto the <code>path</code> array
using SQL&rsquo;s <code>||</code> operator. Having this materialized path allows us to
guard against infinite loops; the WHERE clause makes sure that the row
we&rsquo;re selecting has not appeared in the path before.</p>

<p>This infinite loop check is important. If two categories pointed at each
other as parents, the query would never return. Including this check
prevents such a mistake from killing our server.</p>

<h3>Query the Common Table Expression</h3>

<p>Finally, a WITH query is only useful if you select from it outside of
its declaration, so we&rsquo;ll do just that:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight sql"><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">category_tree</span> <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">path</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to the infinite loop guard, the path column answers the
question &ldquo;How did I get here?&rdquo; Like a directory structure on a file
system, the path demonstrates the ids necessary to get from grandparent
to parent to child, etc.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that we&rsquo;re also ordering by the path column.
We do this because the default sort from a recursive query is
nondeterministic. Normal array sorting works well for us here, and
groups the categories just like we&rsquo;d expect, with parents listed before
their children.</p>

<h2>Using WITH queries in ActiveRecord</h2>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Category</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Base</span>

      )
      SELECT id FROM search_tree ORDER BY path
</span><span class="no">    SQL</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You should notice right away where our recursive query is. The
<code>tree_sql_for</code> class method returns a SQL string that can be used with
other queries. Compared to the WITH query we looked at before, there a
few differences worth mentioning.</p>

<p>First, and probably most importantly for our original problem, we&rsquo;ve
changed our starting place. The non-recursive term is our &ldquo;start here&rdquo;
result set. Rather than starting with all top-level categories, we&rsquo;re
using the id of whichever instance is passed in to scope our tree.</p>

<p>Another change we&rsquo;ve made is to remove the <code>name</code> column from the query.
It isn&rsquo;t necessary for what we&rsquo;re doing, but made the example easier to
demonstrate. We&rsquo;re also interpolating the table name. This makes the
method much more reusable. In fact, we could extract the method to a
<code>RecursiveTree</code> module to tidy up our class.</p>

<p>One big advantage of the SQL approach here is that we can create scopes
to further filter our results within just one database round-trip.
For example, the <code>tree_for</code> class method is really just a named scope
that takes a category instance as a parameter.</p>

<p>Likewise, the the <code>descendent_pictures</code> method returns a CatPicture
relation that includes all pictures from this category and all
subcategories. In other words, what used to take 2 database round trips
for each category in the tree (one to grab children, one to get its
pictures) will now only take 1 for the entire set.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Taking advantage of PostgreSQL&rsquo;s advanced features can provide large
performance boons, especially when a tree get several levels deep.</p>

<p>Although using database recursion is an efficient way of improving
performance with our existing schema, other methods of handling tree
structures in SQL exist. The <a title="SQL Antipatterns book" href="http://pragprog.com/book/bksqla/sql-antipatterns">SQL Antipatterns</a> book has a great
breakdown of other tree solutions that would require schema changes.</p>

<h2>Example app</h2>

<p>As before, while writing this post, I created a <a title="Example application with recursive tree SQL" href="https://github.com/jgdavey/tree-sql-example">sample Rails app</a> to
iterate quickly. I used TDD to write the pure-ruby approach, and reused
the specs while I &ldquo;refactored&rdquo; the implementation to the subsequent
approaches. Of particular note is the <a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/tree-sql-example/commits/master/app/mo
dels/category.rb">history of the Category
model</a>, which mirrors the code above.</p>
