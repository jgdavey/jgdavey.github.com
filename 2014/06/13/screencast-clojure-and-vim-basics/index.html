<h2>Screencast: Clojure + vim basics</h2>
<p>In this screencast I cover how to do basic evaluation and get Clojure
documentation from within vim. I&rsquo;m also including the transcript below.</p>

<iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/98052766" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Vim is a powerful text editor. Clojure is a powerful programming
language. While its been possible to edit Clojure code in vim for years,
the toolchain has improved greatly over the past year. Today we&rsquo;re going
to see how we can integrate vim with our Clojure REPL environment.</p>

<h1>Life without integration</h1>

<p>In a shell session, let&rsquo;s fire up a Clojure REPL. I&rsquo;m going to use <code>lein
repl</code> to do this. In another shell session, let&rsquo;s start vim and edit a
clojure file.</p>

<p>As I edit my file, I can copy code from the editor, switch to the window
with the REPL in it, and paste that code in. This works, but it&rsquo;s an
awkward, slow process. REPLs are supposed to be all about fast feedback.
We can do better than copy and paste.</p>

<h1>Plugins</h1>

<p>Before we get started, we should get the some basic plugins for clojure
development. Using your preferred vim plugin manager, add these plugins:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight plaintext">guns/vim-clojure-static
tpope/fireplace.vim
</code></pre>

<h1>Setup</h1>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve installed the necessary Vim plugins, enter a project
directory. For example, if you have a leiningen project, cd into the
directory. In one shell session, fire up a REPL with <code>lein repl</code>. In
another shell session, cd that that folder once again, and then open
vim.</p>

<p>Fireplace is able to detect when you are in the same directory as an
active REPL, and will attempt to automatically connect for you. This
process is transparent, but should be obvious once we attempt to to send
a command to the connected REPL.</p>

<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<p>The most basic fireplace command is <code>:Eval</code>. <code>:Eval</code> takes an arbitrary
clojure expression, sends it off to the REPL, and prints the result
for you. For example, we could run <code>:Eval (+ 1 1)</code>, and we would, as
expected, see <code>2</code> printed out. This emulates typing at REPL prompt
directly, but there&rsquo;s much more we can do with our REPL-connected vim
session.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s stay with <code>:Eval</code> for a bit longer. <code>:Eval</code> without any arguments
will send eval and print the outermost form on the current line. For
example, let&rsquo;s look at a simple expression.</p>
<pre><code class="highlight clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">inc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>When we have our cursor on this line and type <code>:Eval</code> with no arguments,
we&rsquo;ll see <code>(2 3 4)</code> printed back.</p>

<p><code>:Eval</code>, as with many vim commands, can also take a range. So,
<code>:1,3Eval</code> would evaluate all of lines 1 through 3. All of the normal
special ranges work here, such as <code>%</code> for the entire file, and <code>&#39;&lt;,&#39;&gt;</code>
for the current selection in visual mode.</p>

<p><code>:Eval</code> works well, but there&rsquo;s a quicker way to get feedback. <code>cp</code> is
the normal mode mapping for doing a simple eval and print. By default,
<code>cp</code> expects a motion. The form that I use most though is <code>cpp</code>, which
will eval and print the innermost form from the cursor&rsquo;s current
position.</p>

<p>To demonstrate what this means, let&rsquo;s look at that expression again.</p>
<pre><code class="highlight clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">inc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>When our cursor is on the <code>m</code> of <code>map</code>, and we type <code>cpp</code>, we&rsquo;ll see
<code>(2 3 4)</code>, just as when we did the plain <code>:Eval</code>. But if we move our
cursor inside the vector and type <code>cpp</code> again, we&rsquo;ll see that inner form
evaluated.</p>

<p>Something unique to fireplace is its concept of a quasi-REPL. This is a
cousin of the <code>cp</code> mappings, but with an intermediate editing window. To
demonstrate this, let&rsquo;s consider the following example.</p>
<pre><code class="highlight clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">-&gt;&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="nb">reverse</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">mapv</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">dec</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre>

<p>In this trivial example, we want to reverse a sequence and decrement
each number. There&rsquo;s a bug in here, but it&rsquo;s in the middle of the
thread-through macro. We could just edit the line directly and
eval/print using <code>cpp</code>, but there&rsquo;s another way to do one-off iterative
development like this.</p>

<p>Type <code>cqc</code> in normal mode. A commandline window will open. This is very
much like a normal vim buffer, with a few notable exceptions:</p>

<ol>
<li>It cannot be modified or saved</li>
<li>Pressing <code>Enter</code> in normal mode sends the current line to the REPL
for eval-ing.</li>
<li>As you run commands, they are added to this buffer.</li>
</ol>

<p>tpope calls this the &ldquo;quasi-repl&rdquo;, and indeed that is the mnemonic for
the mapping itself: <code>cq</code> is the &ldquo;Clojure Quasi-REPL&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re in this special window, let&rsquo;s type the following, and hit
enter:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight clojure"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">map</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">str</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre>

<p>Immediately, we can see the issue. Converting each number to a string
prevents <code>dec</code> from working later on.</p>

<p>Having to type the whole line again isn&rsquo;t always convenient. For those
cases, there&rsquo;s <code>cqq</code>, which is like <code>cqc</code> except that it pre-populates
the command window with the innermost form under the cursor. We can
see this in action by putting our cursor near the beginning of the
thread-through macro, and typing <code>cqq</code>.</p>

<p>You can think of <code>cqq</code> as being very similar to <code>cpp</code>, but with a chance
to edit the line or lines before sending it off to the REPL.</p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>One of the great things about Clojure is that documentation is a
first-class citizen, and builtin functions have documentation attached
to them. With a standard REPL, we can use the <code>doc</code> function to get the
signature and documentation for a given function.</p>

<p>With fireplace, we get this with the <code>:Doc</code> command, and it works just
like <code>doc</code>. To see the documentation for <code>map</code>, for example, type <code>:Doc
map</code>. We immediately see the documentation for the map command printed.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s an even shorter way to look up documentation for a function.
When your cursor is on a word, you can press <code>K</code>, that is <code>Shift</code> and
<code>K</code>. We can try this again with the <code>map</code> function by placing our cursor
on the function itself, and pressing <code>K</code>.</p>

<p>We can also use the <code>:Source</code> command to show the source for a function.
When we do this with <code>map</code>, we see the source code for <code>map</code> from
<code>clojure.core</code>.</p>
