        <p>Few people would dispute the importance of onboarding new members of a
team. Getting to know the other people you&rsquo;ll be working with is vital
to becoming part of a team. This is often done a number of ways, but
at the very least involves introductions and informal get-to-know-you
icebreakers. Depending on the position, it can also involve training
sessions, one-on-one conversations, happy hour meetups or other
social events. Even when the stated topic is about &ldquo;work&rdquo; stuff, good
managers allow and even encourage informal chatting.</p>
<p>If a team is a machine, then socializing is the grease that keeps it
moving fluidly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve remotely for 8 years, for 5 different companies. The kind of
social onboarding that I mention above has been a part of each
position, even when it happens organically. Given how important
socializing is to team health, it should not come as a surprise that
the places that have emphasized social onboarding have also been the
ones that I started contributing to most quickly.</p>
<p>Bringing a new person into a team changes that team fundamentally,
and the healthiest teams I&rsquo;ve been a part of seem to understand that,
emphasizing this social onboarding in ways both subtle and overt.</p>
<p>When a person leaves a company, be it because of downsizing, accepting
an offer at another company, or even just an internal reorganization,
the same priority to the social is not always given. Indeed, even as
projects are handed off, and any HR offboarding procedure is executed
carefully, few teams give adequate attention the <em>social</em> offboarding.</p>
<p>One the most helpful traditions that I&rsquo;ve come to embrace when someone
leaves a team has been a &ldquo;social offboarding&rdquo; call with the team.
Given that I&rsquo;ve been on remote teams, this has looked like an informal
Zoom call and has been a great way to say goodbye, talk about &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
next&rdquo;, and gain some sense of closure. And when I&rsquo;ve been the one
leaving, it has served as a nice palette cleanser amid all of the HR
paperwork and other formalized processes necessary when one leaves a
company.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-this-get-set-up">
  How does this get set up?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#how-does-this-get-set-up">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Depending on the circumstances that a person is leaving, it might just
be a normal Zoom (or whatever) meeting that you make and invite all
the teammates to. But if access to internal tools has been revoked,
this may involve treating the leaving employee like an external
entity, and invite them to a meeting as such. At the very least,
ensuring that you have personal contact information makes this a
possibility.</p>
<h2 id="who-should-come">
  Who should come?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#who-should-come">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>This has usually involved anyone that I worked with every day. If you
are involved in a daily standup meeting, for example, that might be a
good place to start with the &ldquo;guest list&rdquo;. Not everyone feels
comfortable being candid with higher-ups, so use your discretion on
who the team and employee would feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>Of course, you can always as the person leaving who they would <em>like</em>
to have on the call.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-say">
  What do we say?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#what-do-we-say">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Given that this is usually an informal conversation, the folks on the
call can discuss whatever makes sense. However, as a guideline, I&rsquo;d
caution against discussing the terms of the end of the employment or
other topics that could get you in hot water. If the person leaving is
going to another position, they might give some details about what
drew them to the new place, but steer clear of why they are leaving
this team.</p>
<p>This might be a time to reminisce about projects people worked on
together, accomplishments you are proud of, or just re-tell funny
stories. Again, this should be an informal call.</p>
<p>If, however, you are hoping for more structure, here&rsquo;s an approach
I&rsquo;ve taken at several places when I&rsquo;ve left: I offer positive
affirmations about the specific people on the call. I&rsquo;ll address each
person individually, naming the things I appreciate about them as
coworkers or what I may miss about not being on their team anymore.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an illustration using completely made up people and positions:</p>
<pre><code>Alice, I've learned so much from your deep knowledge of Bells, and
your work with Whistles has been inspiring. The team is so lucky
to have you, and I'll miss learning from you.

Bob, you were the first person that reached out to me when I was
new here, and you've never ceased encouraging me even while I
learned the ropes. You've been a great teammate, and I'll miss
having you in my corner.

Charlotte, thank you for trusting me enough to experiment on the
Widget project, even though it was clearly in your area of
expertise. You helped me when I got stuck, and I'm so appreciative.
</code></pre>
<p>People, in general, seem to like when you compliment them, and even
more so when you&rsquo;re able to call out specifics. Every time I&rsquo;ve used
this format, the people on the call have been quite receptive. It&rsquo;s
been a helpful, perhaps even therapeutic, way to spend the last few
minutes of time with these people as teammates.</p>
<p>And when someone else has been the one leaving, this kind of call has
been helpful to me and the rest of the team to have a sense of
closure, and we leave the call with positive vibes.</p>
