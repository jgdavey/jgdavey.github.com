<h2 id="senior-software-engineer-at-roothttpswwwjoinrootcom">Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.joinroot.com">Root</a></h2>
<h3 id="mar-2020---present">Mar 2020 - Present</h3>
<p>Root is an auto insurance provider that uses machine learning to give
safe drivers better rates. I work on the Core Services team, helping
to build and support customer billing, among other things.</p>
<h2 id="senior-software-engineer-at-suitenesshttpswwwsuitenesscom">Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.suiteness.com">Suiteness</a></h2>
<h3 id="sep-2017---feb-2020">Sep 2017 - Feb 2020</h3>
<p>I was one of a handful of full-stack developers for Suiteness, whose
core stack is Clojure, Clojurescript, Postgresql, and Redis. Some
accomplishments I&rsquo;m particularly proud of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing and developing a transitional event system in
Postgresql. The end result was something like Kafka, but without the
deployment overhead.</li>
<li>Moving our large, long-term cache from Redis to Postgresql. With
hundreds of gigabytes of cache data, a disk-based (rather than
RAM-based) cache was necessary. Using Postgresql in this way
involved challenges to get the write performance up, but the end
result scaled beautifully.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="senior-software-engineer-at-sonianhttpswwwbarracudacomproductscloudarchive">Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/cloudarchive">Sonian</a></h2>
<h3 id="nov-2016---sep-2017">Nov 2016 - Sep 2017</h3>
<p>Sonian (acquired by Barracuda) is a cloud-based email archiving
company, with Clojure, Elasticsearch, Postgresql, RabbitMQ, and many
other technologies in its stack. I was a member of the core team,
which was responsible for developing and maintaining the email
ingestion pipeline (including parsing and importing into
Elasticsearch) and the customer metadata system.</p>
<h2 id="principal-developer-at-hashrockethttpswwwhashrocketcom">Principal Developer at <a href="https://www.hashrocket.com">Hashrocket</a></h2>
<h3 id="sep-2010---nov-2016">Sep 2010 - Nov 2016</h3>
<p>While at Hashrocket, a software consultancy specializing in web
applications, I worked with many different clients directly. I really
enjoyed working through the technical challenges, and also the
challenge helping clients find the best solution for their problem
space.</p>
<p>After a year at Hashrocket, I became the de facto leader of the our
Chicago office, a satellite office of the headquarters in
Jacksonville, FL. As the leader of the office, I reported to our CEO,
facilitated interpersonal conflicts between our office&rsquo;s developers,
served as a technical person on sales calls, and led local hiring.</p>

<p>In addition to the projects listed below, my <a href="https://github.com/jgdavey">GitHub</a> profile provides a
fairly comprehensive overview.</p>
<h2 id="clj-pgcopyhttpsgithubcomjgdaveyclj-pgcopy"><a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/clj-pgcopy">clj-pgcopy</a></h2>
<h3 id="clojure-postgresql">Clojure, Postgresql</h3>
<p>This library came about when bulk loading data into Postgresql through
the normal Clojure driver wasn&rsquo;t fast enough, and was becoming the
bottleneck in a nightly ETL process. It uses Postgresql&rsquo;s binary COPY
protocol to load data. For our primarily binary data set, it improved
load performance three-fold, allowing us to scale up how much we could
process each night.</p>
<h2 id="6-degrees-of-kevin-baconhttpsgithubcomjgdaveykevin"><a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/kevin">6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a></h2>
<h3 id="clojure-datomic">Clojure, Datomic</h3>
<p>I used IMDB&rsquo;s data and Datomic to create a &ldquo;graph&rdquo; database for
exploring actors' and actresses' relationships (the famous 6 degrees
of Kevin Bacon game). Datomic is not a graph database, but using a
combination of direct index access and graph traversal algorithms, I
was able to get the kind of performance I wanted, without having to
use a dedicated graph database. While the live version of the site is
no longer deployed, <a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/kevin">the source code</a> is still available on GitHub, and
I <a href="http://joshuadavey.com/2014/04/10/using-datomic-as-a-graph-database/">wrote about the trade-offs involved</a> in using Datomic as graph
database, as well as <a href="http://joshuadavey.com/2015/09/17/bulk-imports-with-datomic/">tips for improved performance while doing bulk
imports into Datomic</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hammockhttpsgithubcomjgdaveyhammock"><a href="https://github.com/jgdavey/hammock">Hammock</a></h2>
<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>
<p>A partial implementation of Clojure written in Ruby, with an
interpreted runtime. After I had implemented about two-thirds of
clojure.core, I paused work on it. As it turns out, an interpreted
language on top of another interpreted language can be painfully
slow. However, in the process of building, I learned a bunch about
Clojure and its internals. I regret nothing.</p>
